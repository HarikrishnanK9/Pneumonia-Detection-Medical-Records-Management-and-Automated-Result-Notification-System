# Pneumonia_Detection

Here is my latest project related to Healthcare 🏥 "Pneumonia Detection,Medical Records Management and Automated Result Notification System" 🏥

🚀 I've developed a Pneumonia Detection System using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and integrated it into a user-friendly Streamlit app.

🔍 How it Works:
- Trained a CNN model using a curated X-ray dataset from Kaggle.
- Employed the VGG16 architecture for accurate pneumonia detection.
- Implemented a Streamlit app for seamless user interaction.

📊 Key Features:
- 🌐 Database Integration:Patient details are securely stored for future reference.
- 📧 Automated Notifications:Patients receive prompt emails with their pneumonia detection results.

🔒 Security and Privacy:
- 🛡️ Ensured data security by configuring a MySQL database for patient records.
- 📨 Used Yagmail for secure and efficient email notifications.

👩‍⚕️ Impact on Healthcare:
- 🌍 This project aims to streamline pneumonia detection, aiding healthcare professionals in making faster and more informed decisions.
- 🌐 Scalable and adaptable for broader healthcare applications.

🙏 Acknowledgments:
- Grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the intersection of Deep Learning and Healthcare.
